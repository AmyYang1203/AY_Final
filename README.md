# Final Outline

## This project will showcase the backgrounds and accomplishments of notable East Asian artists that have made strides when it comes to East Asian representation in televisions, movies and music especially in the United States. The three artists I have chosen are Awkwafina, CL and Mountain Brothers. In terms of aesthetic consistency, each artist's profile page will follow the same basic page structure which is described in the third paragraph.    

## The navigation page will feature profile images of the three artists that will be divided by diagonal lines. The user will be be able to click on an artist's image which will lead them to the artist's custom profile page. When each image is hovered over, opacity will reduce by 50% and the artist's name is white text will appear in the center of the image. 

## Each page will use HTML to insert an audio player that will automatically play a song by the artist and a clip from a music video of said artist as the full-screen background. There will also be SVG vector icons that will visually represent important moments in each artist's career and life. They will be automatically animated in different manners using JavaScript DOM animation. When these images are clicked on they will spin also using CSS animation and reveal a block of text that will briefly describe either a career accomplishment or life moment. CSS will also be used to decorate each title of the page which will just be the artist's name.
